*BEWARE ALPHA SOFTWARE!*

I use this library for my own website w/o problems, but it has not
been tested with different setups yet, and is not complete.  Use at
your own risk.  That said, the source code is rather brief, so you can
review easily and decide for yourself.

* Synopsis
*Makas* generates websites from a tree of [[https://www.promptworks.com/textile][Textile]] files.  It does
not try to deduce any meaning from the structure of that tree
(i.e. where files are in the directory hierarchy), but can generate a
blog from a directory of files named a certain way, if enabled.  See
[[file:doc/example-config/scripts/single-blog.rb][this example]] for how that can be done.  Multiple blogs, RSS feed
generation and copying over static files are supported.

* Dependencies
The Makas library depends on the Ruby standard runtime and the
[[http://redcloth.org/][RedCloth]] library.  See [[file:Gemfile.lock]] for exact versions.

* Usage
Documentation is TBD as this was just extracted from my own personal
blog.  But in the meantime the [[file:doc/][example files]] can be used to make a
working website.

* Contributing
Please open an issue or mail me a patch.  Document your changes
accurately and completely, and write nicely formatted, readable,
elegant, and carefully produced code.

* Issues
** TODO Support Scss and Sass
Automatically convert, if enabled, S*ss files to CSS files during
build.

** TODO Allow arbitrarily-deep breadcrumbs.
See [[file:lib/makas.rb::crumbs%20=%20@link.each_filename.to_a]]

** TODO Generate a sitemap
[[file:lib/makas.rb::def%20generate_pages%20sources_root,%20target_root,%20templates,%20force_regeneration][generate-pages]] should be able to initiate that, given it has a list of
pages already.
