h1. What is this?

This is an example page.  It consists of two main parts: the header, and the body.  The two are separated using a ‘form feed’, ASCII / UTF8 character 0xC, decimal 12.  In Emacs you can enter it as @C-q C-l@.  The header is comprised of key-value pairs utilised when generating the page.  The body contains arbitrary text in Textile markup.

The meaning of the headers depend on the theme, i.e. the collection of templates.  Makas uses the Template header to assign a template to a page.

This example page is used for documentation and testing.
